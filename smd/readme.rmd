## [Creating a nice looking Table 1 with standardized mean differences](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2023-09-26-nice-looking-table-1-with-standardized-mean-difference/)

In the provided repository, I've attempted to closely recreate Table One using standardized mean differences, aiming to emulate what our data generation blogger did. The primary distinction is that I've used gtsummary for the table creation. 
Additionally, for the variable f2_v1, I didn't include the percentage in the missing data. If I had included it, in my opinion, the SMD statistic wouldn't accurately reflect the comparison between the red, blue-green control and the treatment.
